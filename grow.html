        Project Grow's West Park garden was created when the park 
        was fully refurbished in 2011.  The West Park Garden consists of 18 half-sized plots and 
        is located at the east end of West Park and accessed from the parking lot off of Chapin Street. 
        The property is loaned to Project Grow by Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation.
