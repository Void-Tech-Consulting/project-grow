        The plants are grown in USDA Organic Sunshine Mix. However, they are fertilized with Fertrell 3-2-3 Garden Food. 
        Fertrell is a natural fertilizer made of blood meal, feather meal and other natural products, but is not USDA organic 
        because the blood, feathers and other products are not from organically raised animals. We use this fertilizer only 
        after having tried other organically certified fertilizers in the past, which produced unsatisfactory results. Whenever 
        possible, the plants are grown from seeds saved by local gardeners.

            Tomatoes come in a wide range of colors. The most common colors are red-orange and pinkish-red. 
            There are also yellow, orange, green and purplish black tomatoes. If you are looking for classic 
            tomato flavor, choose red-orange or pinkish-red tomatoes. Yellow, orange and green tomatoes tend 
            to have a fruitier and sweeter flavor profile. Bi-color tomatoes have skin and flesh that is a mixture 
            of two or more colors. Typically the color is a combination of red and yellow. Bi-color tomatoes usually 
            are very sweet and may have subtle blends of fruit flavors. Black tomatoes tend to be richly flavored with 
            smoky flavor notes.<br/>

            <br/>Tomatoes are usually separated into groups based on their type (beefsteak, cherry, paste, oxheart, saladette 
            and patio). If you are not familiar with these types, the following profiles include descriptions and some 
            recommendations.
