        The plants are grown in USDA Organic Sunshine Mix. However, they are fertilized with Fertrell 3-2-3 Garden Food. 
        Fertrell is a natural fertilizer made of blood meal, feather meal and other natural products, but is not USDA organic 
        because the blood, feathers and other products are not from organically raised animals. We use this fertilizer only 
        after having tried other organically certified fertilizers in the past, which produced unsatisfactory results. Whenever 
        possible, the plants are grown from seeds saved by local gardeners.
